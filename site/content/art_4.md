[TOC]

We had our first meeting, discussing some of the background of the Python language.

Here is a link to the <a href="../pdfs/python1_slides.pdf">slides</a>.

The last slide shows 3 packages/applications which should be downloaded and installed. For now, ignore the _git_ one (I think git is included in Visual Studio Code). So only need to install the following:

1. Python 3.7 (or 3.6) - [python.org](https://python.org/downloads) - this is Python (CPython) itself. Recommended for Windows 10 users is to just download from the python.org site. Mac users can do that, or use brew. Linux users can use the native package manager, or download from the python.org site. NOTE: make sure you download the 64-bit version if indeed that is your OS flavor.

2. Visual Studio Code - [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) - this is a nice IDE (integrated development environment) for coding and playing with Python and other languages. Give it a whirl. If it has problems, we can try something else. For all: just try installing from the site. And then add this extension (to support the Python language): [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
