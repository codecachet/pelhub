All was True or False in our Truth and Beauty meeting.

Here is a link to the <a href="../pdfs/python4_slides.pdf">slides</a>.

Our next get-together IRL will involve Python lists, for-loops, more on the Standard Library, and whatever else meets the group's fancy.

Suggestions for homework on the previous meetings to help imprint upon the mind forever:

1. Write a terminal-based number guessing game (like the one we did in class), but tell the user on each incorrect guess if they are high or low. Maybe even a temperature as well (warm/cold), depending how close.

2. Write a (non-recursive) program to compute the factorial of a number. _N Factorial_ is defined, for n, as n * (n-1) * (n-2)...1.

YouTube is getting closer! As usual, I ask that you please:
