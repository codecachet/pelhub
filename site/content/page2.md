Our first meeting is scheduled for January 16, 2019, at 7:00pm at the Fairfax
Regional Library (10360 North St, Fairfax, VA 22030). Meeting Room B. Please see [meetup site](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-to-Code-Python-for-the-Web/) for more details and any up-to-date changes.

And please, if you are interested in attending, don't forget to answer some [simple questions](https://goo.gl/forms/bGTz8mGy2d6sNY6S2) so we can best acommodate your needs.

 I realize that there is a a mixture of newbies, programming moderates, and some real experts in our class.  Don't worry - we have you covered, and hopefully everyone will get something out of the course.
