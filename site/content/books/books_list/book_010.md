**For the self-taught programmer, students and those who want a refresh.** This will be out in early March 2019, but it sounds really good! I heard about it on a podcast with the author. It's really down-to-earth, and requires little math. It covers things like graphs (for deciding what to pull in a complex build, for example), machine learning, and even neural nets. It is a "breadth first" book, in that he covers several topics not in depth, but to give you a taste for decding whether to learn more. He pointed out that he uses the new Python feature "type hints" throughout, (which can be contraversial!).
