Yay for our third class! Functions and Fun!

Here is a link to the <a href="../pdfs/python3_slides.pdf">slides</a>.

Our next meeting (this coming Monday) will cover Truth and Beauty in Python, meaning your friend the Bool type, and conditionals. And more fun with functions, because, 
how could you not? We'll learn a bit about the famous Python Standard Library, and how to make it do heavy lifting for us in our programs.

YouTube is getting closer! So, again I ask, at no risk to you....
